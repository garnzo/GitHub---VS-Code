### What is version control and why do you think this is important to software/web developers?

Version control is a tool in Github used by developers (web/software), this tool has revolutionised and comepletely changed the way Developers write code, this tool is important because it makes writing code, game, web and software development a lot cleaner and easier.

### How does GitHub allow software/web developers to collaborate on projects?

Github uses a system called Branching, this is done by having one initial file that has the main project, then when people involved in the project try to make changes to tis file, a Branch is made from the initial file, a copy almost, and these Branches are managed in a folder and reviewed by the file creator/manager.

### Imagine these types of tools didn't exist. How would developers track versions/changes and collaborate on projects? What problems might arise?
