# **Github Questions â†“**

### What is version control and why do you think this is important to software/web developers?

Version control is a tool in Github used by developers (web/software), this tool has revolutionised and comepletely changed the way Developers write code, this tool is important because it makes writing code, game, web and software development a lot cleaner and easier.

### How does GitHub allow software/web developers to collaborate on projects?

Github uses a system called Branching, this is done by having one initial file that has the main project, then when people involved in the project try to make changes to tis file, a Branch is made from the initial file, a copy almost, and these Branches are managed in a folder and reviewed by the file creator/manager.

### Imagine these types of tools didn't exist. How would developers track versions/changes and collaborate on projects? What problems might arise?

Many problems would arise, Big Projects would be managed by hard drive, email and just sitting on some random computer, what if the hard drive corrupted, what if he went and no one had access to the file.
If tools like Github didn't exist, Software development would be 10x harder and would be a pain fort Developers to manage changes and braches.

Push - sends the changes to github
Fetch - looks for the file 
Pull - pulls the changes from github
